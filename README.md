# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis

The entire project's analysis is centered around understanding and optimizing sales performance across various dimensions within a retail or e-commerce environment. The dataset provided includes transactional data that captures details like item quantities sold, unit prices, invoice numbers, dates, and customer information. The goal of the analysis is to extract actionable insights that can drive better decision-making in areas like inventory management, pricing, marketing, and overall business strategy.

Project Objectives:
  The project aims to answer several key business questions by analyzing the sales data, such as:

- Identify Top-Performing Products: Determine the top 5 products based on total sales.
- Evaluate Sales Performance: Calculate average sales per day and per year across all items and regions.
- Country-Specific Insights: Identify the best-selling products in each country.

Note: Canceled transactions are excluded to ensure the accuracy of sales data and investigate items with negative quantities.
